### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Specialist working at Sabre, supporting a Data & Analytics app. I'm also a Product Manager on my own startup company! - more on this soon. I also know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This place contains all of my work, most of them in private folders, but you can see some things here I used to work. I have also my website hosted here (it needs an update since I have not updated this since 2018)

If you want to contact me, you can drop me an email.: [e-mail](mailto:mariano@bordon.uy).
